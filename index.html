        <p> Honey Badgers are a 10k collection inscribed on the BTC Blockchain through Ordinals.
          It's an experiment to see if a native NFT community can emerge and thrive on the native BTC ecosystem.
          <br><br>
          This project is the first 10k pfp BTC original collection that started inscribing on Bitcoin, being the first
          Honey
          Badger the Bitcoin inscription number 81557, created on February 14, 2023, 7:51 AM GMT+1 on Bitcoin (cos we are
          on BITCoIn IS THAT CLEAR U eTHflooeNCER HUH???).
          <br><br>
          With that first Honey Badger, and the love of Valentines day, the den (the community of Honey Badgers) was born.
          <br><br>
          A community where degens share alpha, honey and pings party (we hope you enjoy the beautiful melody of the
          discord notification: buRÃ¡)
          <br><br>
          Also, we have hidden a real mystical honey pot of the power irl with a
          badger skull inside of it, and if you find it, you will free the First Honey Badger
          from its curse: being lost in a random wallet cos we used Sparrows and similar wallets with amazing UX
          to mint cos we were so fkin early.
